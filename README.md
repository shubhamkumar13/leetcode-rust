my pain to get a job in tech

I started this whole repo so that I can get a job. I was never a fan of technical interviews but ultimately the world doesn't care about what I think so here I am<br>

Also I'm going to blog about every single problem that I do on leetcode.<br><br>

These are all problems that I randomly get when I ask leetcode for a problem.<br>

Hope I get a job.
